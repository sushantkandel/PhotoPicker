> A photo pickung app with triangular number validation
### About the App

This app is created on android application using kotlin where user can select 2 pictures from their gallery
by defult the size of list was given 50 but user can change the size any time after the image is populated
the observable pattern is used to reflect the change in the view This project is written in the MVVM design pattern.
On the list the image is popolated on the base of triangular number.

### Triangular Number
A triangular number or triangle number counts objects arranged in an equilateral triangle. Triangular numbers are a type of figurate number, other examples being square numbers and cube numbers. The nth triangular number is the number of dots in the triangular arrangement with n dots on each side, and is equal to the sum of the n natural numbers from 1 to n.The sequence of triangular numbers, starting with the 0th triangular number, is
0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, 66, 78, 91, 105, 120, 136, 153, 171, 190, 210, 231, 253, 276, 300, 325, 351, 378, 406, 435, 465, 496, 528, 561, 595, 630, 666..
 ### To check weather the given number is triangular or not
 ## n = (sqrt(8*X+1)-1)/2
 
 The above formula is used to check weather the given number is triangular or not. If the result i.e value of n is whole number then the number 
 assigned to X is triangular number.
